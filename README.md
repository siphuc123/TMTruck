# Learning Nest.js + Next.js.
- I'm' trying to follow and learn about Nest.js and Next.js through documents, videos and things on the internet

# Idea
- I have a strong passion for cool milk tea, so I want to build a website with everything revolving around milk tea.
- Currently, I'm just learning more and trying to get started, so I still have no idea about the business and the functions needed. So I just tried to create a web application with the right structure and tried to make it beautiful.
